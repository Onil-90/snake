# Snake


This is a minimalistic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)"> snake game<a>. It is my very first pygame project. 
  
 ## Requirements
  
 Use the the command 
 ```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install the packages needed to run the game (pygame and numpy).
  
 ## How to play
  
 Use the arrows on your keyboard to control the snake. Collect the food (red square) that is spawned at random locations in the window. The more food you collect the more points you will get at the end of the game. The game ends when the snake runs into itself. 

Enjoy!
